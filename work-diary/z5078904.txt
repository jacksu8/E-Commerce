Week 1
Group formed. I created the Jira & GitHub accounts. Together with Luke, Jerry & Tim, add extra product features for E-commerce web app. 
I also found and discussed with the team all available software tools and libraries that we can use for the project.
Programming language tools:
	- frontend: REACT JavaScript (yarn? npm?)
	- backend: python (flask?)
	- database: postgresql
	- docker (depends on teams, to have a constant working environment)
	- job processor (need to find one, for concurrent jobs)
